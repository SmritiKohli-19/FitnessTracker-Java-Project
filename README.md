# 🏃‍♀️ Java Fitness Tracker

A Java-based fitness tracking application developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming** (CST8132) course at Algonquin College. This program calculates the 
fitness level of users based on steps taken, calories burned, and active minutes. It applies OOP principles, control structures, and method-based calculations.

## 📁 Project Structure


- `FitnessTracker.java`: Main class containing all logic and methods for fitness calculations.
- `FitnessTrackerTest.java`:This class asks for the inputs from the patient and calls the different methods using an object. 
- `FitnessTrackerTest2.java`: This class tests the different methods using test cases which includes three successful and three unsuccessful.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (OpenJDK 21.0.4 LTS)
- Eclipse IDE (or any Java-compatible IDE)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Calculates distance walked based on gender and step count.
- Computes weekly active minutes and calories burned.
- Determines user’s fitness level using conditional logic.
- Provides calorie surplus/deficit information.
- Displays all personal fitness details in a structured format.

## 🧠 Fun Fact

This project was a stepping stone toward applying real-world data analysis logic using Java and sets the foundation for fitness-based app development. It helped in 
co-relating with one of my personal web development project which also about fitness.
